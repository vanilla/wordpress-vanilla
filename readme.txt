**Community Forums Evolved.**

At Vanilla, we believe that online communities should be unique, intuitive and engaging. Vanilla allows you to create a customized community that rewards positive participation, automatically curates content and lets members drive moderation.

Vanilla provides hosted and open source community forum software that powers discussion forums on over 500,000 sites. Built for flexibility and integration, Vanilla is the best, most powerful community solution in the world.

Vanilla focuses on easy integration with WordPress, and is the ONLY forum solution to provide a native mobile version for easy browsing and posting from any mobile device.

Vanilla benefits from the power of open-source, with over 10,000 developers contributing to the project and over 500 addons that can make your community do anything you need it to do. Vanilla is truly open-source, standards-compliant, and fully customizable.

Migrating to Vanilla from any other forum platform is a breeze, with ready-made exporters for vBulletin, phpBB, bbPress, and more.
